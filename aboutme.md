### Resume

I obtained my Bachelor in Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Bordeaux in 2021. I received my Master's degree in 2023 in [Cryptography and Cybersecurity](https://mastercsi.labri.fr/) at University of Bordeaux.

I am now working on a completely different subject. After a research internship with [Jérémie Bigot](https://sites.google.com/site/webpagejbigot/), I started my PhD under the supervision of Jérémie and [Elsa Cazelles](https://www.irit.fr/~Elsa.Cazelles/) in november 2023. We are interested in the application of optimal transport to flow cytometry data, in the context of acute leukemia.
